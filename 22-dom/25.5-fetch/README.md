Actual Deliverables
As a user I want...

to be able to click the button and add a taco emoji to the list
to be able to click an emoji and change it to a coconut
to be able to right-click an emoji and delete it
to be able to click an emoji and cycle through ["🍩", "🌮", "🥥", "🍣"] * This one is really hard — feel free to attempt but it's nothing to be discouraged by if you struggle with it!
Gotchas
